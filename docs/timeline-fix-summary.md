# Timeline Playback Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Timeline Started at END Instead of Beginning ❌→✅
**Problem:**
- Timeline initialized at `currentIndex = snapshots.length - 1` (index 11 = December 2024)
- When user pressed Play, it started from the last snapshot

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before
this.currentIndex = this.snapshots.length - 1; // Start at most recent

// After
this.currentIndex = 0; // Start at first snapshot (beginning of timeline)
```

### Issue 2: Play Skipped First Snapshot ❌→✅
**Problem:**
- Play() would reset to index 0, then immediately call next() → jumped to index 1
- User never saw January (index 0) properly

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before
play() {
    if (this.currentIndex >= this.snapshots.length - 1) {
        this.currentIndex = 0;
        this.notifyChange();
    }
    this.playInterval = setInterval(() => {
        this.next(); // Immediately skips index 0
    }, speed);
}

// After
play() {
    if (this.currentIndex >= this.snapshots.length - 1) {
        this.currentIndex = 0;
    }
    // Show current snapshot FIRST
    this.notifyChange();

    // THEN start advancing
    this.playInterval = setInterval(() => {
        const hasNext = this.next();
        if (!hasNext) {
            this.pause();
            console.log('[TIMELINE] Playback complete');
        }
    }, speed);
}
```

### Issue 3: HTML Slider Started at Wrong Position ❌→✅
**Problem:**
- HTML had `value="11"` (December) and display showed "December 2024"

**Fix:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<input type="range" id="timeline-slider" min="0" max="11" value="11">
<div id="timeline-display">December 2024</div>

<!-- After -->
<input type="range" id="timeline-slider" min="0" max="11" value="0">
<div id="timeline-display">January 2024 (1/12)</div>
```

## How It Works Now

### Expected Behavior:

1. **On Page Load:**
   - Timeline shows: "January 2024 (1/12)"
   - Slider position: Far left (value = 0)
   - Current snapshot: Index 0 (2024-01-01)

2. **When Play is Pressed:**
   - Shows January 2024 (snapshot 1 of 12)
   - Waits 2 seconds
   - Advances to February 2024 (snapshot 2 of 12)
   - Slider moves right by 1/12th
   - Waits 2 seconds
   - Advances to March 2024 (snapshot 3 of 12)
   - ... continues ...
   - Advances to December 2024 (snapshot 12 of 12)
   - Slider at far right
   - **Playback stops** (does NOT loop)

3. **Console Logs:**
   ```
   [TIMELINE] Advanced to snapshot 2 of 12
   [TIMELINE] Advanced to snapshot 3 of 12
   ...
   [TIMELINE] Advanced to snapshot 12 of 12
   [TIMELINE] Already at last snapshot (12), cannot advance
   [TIMELINE] Playback complete - reached last snapshot
   ```

### Snapshot Progression:

| Snapshot # | Date | Display | Slider Position |
|------------|------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | 2024-01-01 | January 2024 (1/12) | 0/11 (0%) |
| 2 | 2024-02-01 | February 2024 (2/12) | 1/11 (9%) |
| 3 | 2024-03-01 | March 2024 (3/12) | 2/11 (18%) |
| 4 | 2024-04-01 | April 2024 (4/12) | 3/11 (27%) |
| 5 | 2024-05-01 | May 2024 (5/12) | 4/11 (36%) |
| 6 | 2024-06-01 | June 2024 (6/12) | 5/11 (45%) |
| 7 | 2024-07-01 | July 2024 (7/12) | 6/11 (55%) |
| 8 | 2024-08-01 | August 2024 (8/12) | 7/11 (64%) |
| 9 | 2024-09-01 | September 2024 (9/12) | 8/11 (73%) |
| 10 | 2024-10-01 | October 2024 (10/12) | 9/11 (82%) |
| 11 | 2024-11-01 | November 2024 (11/12) | 10/11 (91%) |
| 12 | 2024-12-01 | December 2024 (12/12) | 11/11 (100%) |

## Key Points

### ✅ Snapshot-Based Navigation
- Timeline ONLY shows the 12 snapshots in the data
- No interpolation or daily increments
- Each snapshot represents 1st of the month

### ✅ Linear Progression
- Slider moves evenly: 1/12th per snapshot
- Each step represents exactly one snapshot
- No gaps, no skips

### ✅ Stops at End
- When reaching last snapshot (December), playback stops
- Does NOT loop back to beginning
- Pause is automatically called

### ✅ User Can Control
- **Play (▶)**: Start from current position
- **Pause (⏸)**: Stop at current snapshot
- **Reset (⏮)**: Jump to January (first snapshot)
- **Slider**: Drag to any snapshot instantly

## Testing Checklist
