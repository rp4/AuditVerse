  const hasAudit = relationships.some(rel =>
    (rel.source === risk.id || rel.target === risk.id) &&
    audits.some(audit => audit.id === rel.source || audit.id === rel.target)
  );
  return !hasAudit;
});
```

### Uncontrolled Risks Query Logic
```javascript
const uncontrolledRisks = risks.filter(risk => {
  const hasControl = relationships.some(rel =>
    rel.source === risk.id &&
    controls.some(control => control.id === rel.target)
  );
  return !hasControl;
});
```

### High Issue Risks Query Logic
```javascript
const riskIssueCounts = risks.map(risk => {
  const issueCount = relationships.filter(rel =>
    rel.source === risk.id &&
    issues.some(issue => issue.id === rel.target)
  ).length;
  return { ...risk, issueCount };
}).sort((a, b) => b.issueCount - a.issueCount);
```

## 9. Data Structure Requirements

### Current Structure Compatibility

The existing AuditVerse data structure supports approximately 80% of the preset views without modification. The current structure includes:

#### Existing Entities
- **Risks**: id, name, category, inherent_rating, residual_rating, inherent_likelihood, residual_likelihood, inherent_severity, residual_severity
- **Controls**: id, name, description
- **Issues**: id, name, status
- **Incidents**: id, name, description
- **Business Units/Entities**: id, name, type
- **Standards**: id, name, framework
- **Audits**: id, name, scope
- **Relationships**: source, target, type (connecting all entities)

#### Views That Work with Current Structure âœ…
1. **Unaudited Risks** - Can identify risks without audit relationships
2. **Uncontrolled Risks** - Can find risks without control relationships
3. **Unmonitored Standards** - Can identify standards without audit coverage
4. **Audit Blind Spots** - Can find business units without audits
5. **High Issue Risks** - Can count issue relationships per risk
6. **High Incident Risks** - Can count incident relationships per risk
7. **Problem Business Units** - Can aggregate issues/incidents by unit
8. **High Residual Risk** - Uses existing residual_rating field
9. **Enterprise Risk Profile** - Uses existing risk ratings
10. **Cross-Unit Risks** - Can identify risks connected to multiple units
11. **Audit Universe Coverage** - Can calculate coverage percentages

### Required Enhancements for Full Functionality

To support all preset views with complete functionality, the following optional fields should be added:

  "recovery_time": 4.5                 // NEW: hours to recover
}]
```

#### 3. Control Effectiveness Metrics
Essential for control performance views:

```javascript

  "automation_level": "manual"        // NEW: automated|semi-automated|manual
}]
```

#### 4. Enhanced Relationship Attributes
For more sophisticated filtering and analysis:

```javascript
"relationships": [{
  "source": "R1",
  "target": "C1",
  "type": "mitigated_by",
  "strength": 0.8,                    // NEW: Relationship strength (0-1)
  "confidence": 0.9,                  // NEW: Confidence level (0-1)
  "created_date": "2023-01-01",       // NEW: When relationship established
  "validated_date": "2024-01-01",     // NEW: Last validation
  "notes": "Primary control"          // NEW: Additional context
}]
```

#### 5. Risk Metadata
For emerging risk and trend analysis:

```javascript
"risks": [{
  "id": "R1",
  "name": "Data Breach Risk",
  "created_date": "2023-01-01",       // NEW: For emerging risk detection
  "last_reviewed": "2024-01-01",      // NEW: Last risk assessment date
  "trend": "increasing",               // NEW: increasing|stable|decreasing
  "velocity": "fast",                  // NEW: fast|medium|slow
  "owner": "IT Security Team",         // NEW: Risk owner
  "regulatory": true                   // NEW: Subject to regulations
}]
```

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Data Migration
For existing installations, provide:
- Data enrichment tools
- Bulk update capabilities

#### Phase 2: Import/Export Updates
- Update denormalized export to include new fields
- Update import to handle optional fields
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Data Structure Validation

```javascript
// Validation function for enhanced data
function validateEnhancedData(data) {
  const warnings = [];

  // Check for temporal data
  if (data.audits?.some(a => !a.date_performed)) {
    warnings.push("Audits missing dates - time-based views limited");
  }

  // Check for severity data
  if (data.issues?.some(i => !i.severity)) {
    warnings.push("Issues missing severity - weighted analysis limited");
  }

  // Check for control effectiveness
  if (data.controls?.some(c => !c.effectiveness_score)) {
    warnings.push("Controls missing effectiveness - performance views limited");
  }

  return warnings;
}
```

### Benefits of Enhanced Structure

1. **Time-based Analysis**: Track audit cycles, issue aging, incident patterns
2. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-severity items first
3. **Effectiveness Measurement**: Quantify control performance
4. **Trend Analysis**: Identify improving/deteriorating areas
5. **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor regulatory requirements
6. **Resource Optimization**: Data-driven audit planning

### Minimal Viable Enhancement

If only one enhancement can be made, prioritize adding **date fields** to audits:

```javascript
"audits": [{
  "date_performed": "2024-03-15"  // Minimum required for time-based views
}]
```

This single addition enables:
- Stale audit detection
- Coverage gap analysis
- Audit frequency tracking
- Compliance monitoring
